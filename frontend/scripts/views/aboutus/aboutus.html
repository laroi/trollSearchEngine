                Hey Trollers,<br><br>
                <p>This is a hobby project we started aiming to make plain memes searchable. It all started some time back when one of us wanted to reply to a friend with a meme. Like many of you, he tried <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> will not let <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> index their data. So you can't see it in <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>  itself is not very good at searching posts. And the posts never had any structure. So he tried alternatives like <a href="https://www.makeachali.com/" target="_blank">Make a Chali</a> and <a href="http://www.whykol.com/" target="_blank">Whykool</a>. <a href="https://www.makeachali.com/" target="_blank">Make a Chali</a> is a good initiative, but not well maintained and is very hard to use, while <a href="http://www.whykol.com/" target="_blank">Whykool</a> is very tedious to search. Needless to say, he couldn't reply to his friend on time, and it was very embarrassing. This whole thing resembled Internet in mid 90s, there was a bunch of search engines, none did what it was supposed to do, In reasonably good way.</p>
                 <p> All of these brings us to the main meme search application <a href="https://www.memezero.com/" target="_blank">memezero</a>. At this point, memezero holds most number of memes. Even though the application is quite popular, there are some problems with it. The main problem we see is the third party app usage, Like facebook for login, and google for analytics. Another main problem is the ads. We do understand that ads are the only source of income and hence ads are fine. But if an ad starts tracking users, that is not at all cool. Also, the application is so one way, there is no way to request a mem that you need. And the site lack modern web features. We intend to index all the plain memes in a structured way so that you can find them with ease. Primary objective is to find specific meme without trying hard</p>
                <p>Some people use <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> mainly to read trolls (and may be to back up photos). If you are one of them who are stuck with <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> just for reading trolls even if you don't want to use it, you could use this application. In the recent light of incidents with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/26/the-cambridge-analytica-files-the-story-so-far" target="_blank">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, if anyone wants to stay as less as possible from <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and still enjoy reading the trolls, this could be a potential place</p> 
                <p>We also think <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>  is not designed specifically for memes, for example, reply for a meme should not be redundant. Also, all the replies and replies of replies should be grouped together. Currently there is no way to do this. Another problem with <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> groups are that they will give away your identity This could be problem for those who want appreciate a good troll in groups like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MNTROLLS/" target="_blank">MNT</a>.</p>
                <p>There will be absolutely no tracking of users (not even google analytics). We also will not, under any circumstance, allow any ad trackers to track you by our application. while using this website, your comminication will be with our servers and our servers only. We respect our users privacy, you might have already noticied it if you have completed the registration</p>
